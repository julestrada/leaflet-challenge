# leaflet-challenge
The html and js assignemnts are the hardest ones, so this was a struggle.  
Using the solution and google I mapped the earthquake points. 
I used the GEOJSON and D3 and leaflet to plot the lot and lang. 
I made sure to create a legend so that it could be visualized on how severe the earthquakes were.
